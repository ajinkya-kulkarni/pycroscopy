# This program provides an example use of the kpfm_bayesian and kpfm_bayesian_utils scripts.
# The KPFM Process class is functional, but this code does not process the data correctly, probably
# due to inappropriate inputs. This is meant to act as only an example to use when writing actual code.

import h5py
from .kpfm_bayesian import KPFMBayesianInference

# This is the path to the h5 file in which the data to be process is stored
h5_path = r"C:\Users\Administrator\Dropbox\polynomial approximation paper\G data\GFA0_n1000mV_0003\GFA0_n1000mV_0003.h5"

with h5py.File(h5_path, mode="r+") as h5_file:
    # We pull out the dataset that holds data reshaped into pixels (or any arrangement where each row is a
    # separate entity to be analyzed)
    h5_group = h5_file["Measurement_000/Channel_000/Raw_Data-Reshape_000"]
    h5_main = h5_group["Reshaped_Data"]

    # Create a dictionary of physical parameters of the measurement setup. See get_default_parameters() in
    # kpfm_bayesian_utils for a sample declaration of this dictionary. In the case of this example code,
    # I have no idea what these values should be, so I will just input None and use the default values.
    p = None

    # Instantiate the KPFM Process class with the reshaped dataset and the parameter dictionary
    kbi = KPFMBayesianInference(h5_main, p=p)

    ##### Running test() #####

    # We can run the Bayesian inference algorithm on a single random pixel, and return the resulting graphs
    pix_ind, resultGraphs = kbi.test(verbose=True)
    resultGraphs[0].savefig("3DplotOn{}.png".format(pix_ind))
    resultGraphs[1].savefig("OtherPlotsOn{}.png".format(pix_ind))

    # Or on a particular pixel if you so choose

    resultGraphs[0].savefig("3DplotOn{}.png".format(pix_ind))
    resultGraphs[1].savefig("OtherPlotsOn{}.png".format(pix_ind))

    ##### Running compute() #####

    # And if everything is looking good, we can run the Bayesian inference on the entire dataset and save
    # the results. compute() returns a reference to the group that holds the generated data, if you are
    # interested in looking through that
    resultGroup = kbi.compute()
